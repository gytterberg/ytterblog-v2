        Hello! This is a demonstration project developed by Gabriel Ytterberg.
        Gabriel Ytterberg is a software developer with experience in JavaScript,
        Python, and Java. This site is written in ES6 JavaScript using the React
        framework, and the back end is written in Python using the Django
        framework. The blog page does not use authentication, so anyone can
        experiment with the features. For more details and code, see the About
        page, or inspect the code at my GitHub page.
